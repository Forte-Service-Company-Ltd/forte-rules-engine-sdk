 *
 * @dependencies
 * - `viem`: Provides utilities for encoding/decoding data and interacting with Ethereum contracts.
 * - `Parser`: Contains helper functions for parsing rule syntax, trackers, and foreign calls.
 * - `@wagmi/core`: Provides utilities for simulating, reading, and writing to Ethereum contracts.
 * - `config`: Provides configuration for interacting with the blockchain.
